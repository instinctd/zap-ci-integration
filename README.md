# ZAP Scan and DefectDojo Integration
This project integrates OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) with DefectDojo, providing automated security scanning and report uploading.

# Description
The application consists of a Flask web server that listens for incoming webhooks to start a ZAP scan on a specified target. The scan results are then uploaded to DefectDojo for further analysis and tracking.

# Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- OWASP ZAP
- DefectDojo

# Installation
Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zap-defectdojo-integration.git
cd zap-defectdojo-integration
```
# Install the required Python packages:
```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```


# Set up the environment variables for ZAP and DefectDojo:

```
  export ZAP_API_KEY='your_zap_api_key'
  export DOJO_API_KEY='your_defectdojo_api_key'
  export DOJO_URL='your_defectdojo_url'
  export DOJO_TEST_TYPE='your_defectdojo_test_type'  # Optional, default is 'ZAP Scan'
```

# Run the Flask application:
```
python app.py
```
# Usage
The application listens for POST requests on the /webhook endpoint. The request should contain a JSON payload with the following fields:

image: The target URL to be scanned.
engagement_id: The DefectDojo engagement ID.

Example request:

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/webhook \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
          "image": "example.com",
          "engagement_id": "12345"
        }'

```

# Logging
The application logs important events and errors using Python's built-in logging module.

# Code Structure
- app.py: Main application script containing the Flask server and ZAP scanning logic.
- config.py: Configuration script to read API keys and settings from environment variables.
# Improvements

- Configuration Management: Consider using a configuration management tool like dotenv to manage environment variables more effectively.
- Error Handling: Improve error handling, especially for file operations and network requests, to provide more detailed feedback in case of failures.
- Unit Tests: Add unit tests to ensure the functionality of the application is robust and to prevent future regressions.
- Concurrency Management: Evaluate and optimize the concurrency model, possibly using a task queue like Celery for managing scan tasks more efficiently.
- Security: Ensure sensitive data is handled securely, especially API keys and scan results.
- Documentation: Expand the documentation to include detailed setup instructions, API endpoint descriptions, and example payloads.
- Containerization: Consider containerizing the application using Docker to simplify deployment and ensure consistency across different environments.
-  Error Reporting: Implement more detailed logging and error reporting, potentially integrating with an error tracking tool like Sentry.
